/**
 * 1.[LeetCode,759] We are given a list avail of employees, which represents the free time for
 * each employee.
 * Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted
 * order.
 * Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all
 * employees, also in sorted order.
 * Example :
 * Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
 * Output: [[3,4]]
 * Explanation:
 * There are a total of three employees, and all common
 * free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
 * We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
