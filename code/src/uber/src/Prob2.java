/**
 * [LeetCode,154] Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot
 unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 Find the minimum element.
 The array may contain duplicates.
 Example:
 Note:
 · This is a follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array".
 · Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
