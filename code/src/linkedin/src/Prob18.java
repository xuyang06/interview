 * Within in one week, they arranged a Technical Phone Screen Interview. This interview
 * involved a real-time collaborative editor which allows me to do actual coding.
 * It was a two dimensional array problem, the interviewer helped me to go through the process.
 * After that he asked a lot of modeling questions. For example, describe a machine learning
 * method, how to deal with sparse data?
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If there are some sparse data, how to do the modeling?

 * <p>
 * I passed the first phone screen (basic data mining  questions, including the concepts
 * of classification and clustering; and a simple dp question which is quite similar
 * to "Climbing Stairs"), and failed the second one right after I came back
 * from another state (basic nlp questions, like named entity extraction,
 * and basic data mining questions, like SVM, naive bayes; and a sampling question
 * which is quite similar to Reservoir sampling).
