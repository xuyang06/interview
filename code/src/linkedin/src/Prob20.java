 * <p>
 * <p>
 * I got a one hour phone interview first, in first half hour we discussed my experience
 * in Machine Learning and was asked questions like: how Decision Tree works,
 * why you choose SVM instead of other algorithm and etc. Second half hour spent
 * on coding to solve a shortest path question between two nodes in a graph.
 * <p>
 * After the phone interview, I got on-site invitations to their HQ.
 * Five sessions includes one with host manager. The rest four technical session was
 * about: 1) Algorithm 2) Data coding 3) Data mining / Machine Learning and
