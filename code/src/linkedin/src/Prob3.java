 * linkedin第二轮ML电面，是两位非常Nice的中国小哥，两个人都非常好。先问了project的细节问了大概15分钟，
 * 然后开始问machine learning theory,然后是统计知识和ml design.
 * <p>
 * ML Theory:
 * 1.binary classifiers: logistic cost function, overfitting,
 * how to prevent, regulariation, decision trees, random forest,
 * neural networks, embeddings, convolutional neural network,
 * how to prevent overfitting in neural network.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 统计：
 * 1. p value, how to detect outliners, how to treat outliers,
 * how to compare mean of the distributions
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ml design:
 * design people you may know
