 * Pretty straightforward interview process. Went through a phone screen, then 4 onsite interviews. This included a lunch break with 2 engineers and the usual recruiter wrap-up. The experience was good, interviewers were positive and helpful. The office is in downtown SF and they flew me over, covered the cost of a hotel night.
