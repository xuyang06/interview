/**
 * Declined Offer
 * Neutral Experience
 * Easy Interview
 * Application
 * <p>
 * I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Flexport (San Francisco, CA) in February 2019.
 * <p>
 * Interview
 * <p>
 * Connected through recruiter network. Skipped phone screen on strength of having other onsites scheduled. Onsite was a simple laptop coding exercise, whiteboard coding, somewhat challenging system design question, and a talk-through-your-experience interview. Interviewers were friendly and smart, but had trouble communicating with the last interviewer.
 * <p>
 * Interview Questions
 * <p>
 * Something involving a keypad (should probably use a harder question for senior candidates)
 * Answer Question
