/**
 * Declined Offer
 * Negative Experience
 * Average Interview
 * Application
 * <p>
 * I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day.
 * I interviewed at Flexport (San Francisco, CA) in March 2019.
 * <p>
 * Interview
 * <p>
 * Six hours onsite with two programming challenges,
 * a design challenge, and a deep-dive into some prior projects.
 * The engineers seemed to not care about their jobs, had no enthusiasm,
 * and were just going through the motions. They admitted at the on-site they
 * don't do anything special for logistics with their 3% market share,
 * and most of the workflow is manual with human entry and scheduling -
 * there is no ML. There is no ML on the roadmap either. That was highly disappointing, so I declined the offer. The other Glassdoor interview reviews were unfortunately bang on. Read them all - they converge on an inescapable theme.
 * Show Less
 * <p>
 * Interview Questions
 * <p>
 * 1) Create DB schema for some API, 2) Implement some Markov Chain string writer, 3) Some sorting question
