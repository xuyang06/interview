     * Add these operations to your library: Addition, dot product, and cosine. Formulae for each
     are provided below; we’re more interested in you writing the code than whether you’ve
     memorized the formula. For each operation, your code should throw an error if the two
     input vectors are not equal length.
     Sample input/output:
     //Note: This is pseudocode. Your actual syntax will vary by language.
     v1 = new vector(5)
     v1[0] = 4.0
     v1[1] = 5.0
     v2 = new vector(5)
     v2[1] = 2.0
     v2[3] = 3.0
     v3 = new vector(2)
     print v1.add(v2) //should print [4.0, 7.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0]
     print v1.add(v3) //error -- vector lengths don’t match
     print v1.dot(v2) //should print 10
     print v1.dot(v3) //error -- vector lengths don’t match.
     print v1.cos(v2) //should print 0.433
     print v1.cos(v3) //error -- vector lengths don’t match
     Formulae:
     Addition
     a.add(b) = [a[0]+b[0], a[1]+b[1], a[2]+b[2], ...]
     Dot product
     a.dot(b) = a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1] + a[2]*b[2] + ...
     Cosine
     a.cos(b) = a.dot(b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))
     //norm(a) = sqrt(a[0]^2 + a[1]^2 + a[2]^2 + ...)
