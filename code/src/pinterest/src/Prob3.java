     * 1. [LeetCode,277] Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and
     among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other
     n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
     Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing
     you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information
     of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by
     asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
     You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B.
     Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of
     calls to knows.
     Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's
     label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.


     2. [LeetCode,759] We are given a list avail of employees, which represents the free time
     for each employee.
     Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted
     order.
     Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all
     employees, also in sorted order.
     Example :

     3.sorte integer array, 找occurence ⼤大于n/4 的elements,然后扩展到n/k,然后扩展到array 特
     别⼤大。

     * 1.国人小姐姐。设计实现battle ship游戏。主要是代码实现，跟OOD没关系。

     2.manager 吃饭聊天。

     3.印度小哥。LC277，LC759

     4.白人小哥，类似json parser.输入是 string path 和 JSONObject.
     比如path ="$.store.book.author", 要把这个JSONObject里面的author的value 返回。
     json是nested,并且有array

     5.日本小哥，sorte integer array, 找occurence大于n/4的elements,
     然后扩展到n/k,然后扩展到array特别大，多机怎么处理。
