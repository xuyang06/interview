 * 1. [LeetCode,681]Given a time represented in the
 format “HH:MM”, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There
 is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.
 You
 may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, “01:34”, “12:09”
 are all valid. “1:34”, “12:9” are all invalid.
 2.[Leetcode,683] There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N
 flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower
 blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.
 Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array
 represents the place where the flower will open in that day.
 For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at
 position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.
 Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the
 status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers
 are not blooming.
 If there isn't such day, output -1.
