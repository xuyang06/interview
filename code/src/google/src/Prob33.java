 * 1. [LeetCode,337] The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is
 only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and
 only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place
 forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses
 were broken into on the same night.
 Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the
 police.
 Example 1:
 3
 / \
 2 3
 \ \
 3 1
 Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 2.给⼀一个数组和⼀一个int k，找出第k 个缺失的数据。⽐比如 1，2，3，5，6，9，10，11，13，k=3，
 missing value 是4，7，8，12 , 返回第k 个missing value。
 A good follow up: Quick selection
 3.设计⼀一个开宝箱class 要求 1.随机 2.这次开出来的东⻄西在k 次之后才能再开出来
