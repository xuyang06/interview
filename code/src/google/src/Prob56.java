 * 1.[LeetCode,444] Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed
 from the sequences in seqs. The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n,
 with 1 ≤ n ≤ 104. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the
 sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are
 subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be
 reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.
 Example 1:
 Input:
 org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2],[1,3]]
 Output:
 false
 Explanation:
 [1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid
 sequence that can be reconstructed.
