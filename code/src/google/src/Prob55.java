 * 1.[LeetCode,686] Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to
 be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
 For
 example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".Return 3,
 because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it;
 and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
 Note:The
 length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
 2. [LeetCode,687] Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node
 in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
 between them.
 Example 1:
 Input:
 5
