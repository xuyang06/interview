 * 1.[LeetCode,686] Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to
 be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
 For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".Return 3, because by repeating A three
 times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two
 times ("abcdabcd").
 Note:The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
 2. 求⼆二叉树中值相同相连的节点的最⼤大数量量（其实是edge 数，节点数要减⼀一）
