 * Created by yangxu on 8/4/18.
 * [LeetCode,307] Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices
 i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.
 The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.
 Example:
 Given nums = [1, 3, 5]
 sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
 update(1, 2)
 sumRange(0, 2) -> 8
 Note:
 1. The array is only modifiable by the update function.
 2. You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is
 distributed evenly.
