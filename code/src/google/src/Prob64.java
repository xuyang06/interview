 * 1. [LeetCode,681]Given a time represented in the format “HH:MM”, form the next closest
 time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be
 reused.
 You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, “01:34”, “12:09” are
 all valid. “1:34”, “12:9” are all invalid.
 2. [LeetCode,605]Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are
 planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they
 would compete for water and both would die.
 Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and
 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without
 violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 Example 1:
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 Output: True
 Example 2:
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 Output: False
 Note:
 The input array won’t violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
 n is a non-negative integer which won’t exceed the input array size.
