 * 1. [LeetCode, 659] You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain
 duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences
 consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.
 Example 1:
 Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
 Output: True
 Explanation:
 You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
 1, 2, 3
 3, 4, 5
 2. [LeetCode, 652] Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of
 duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.
 Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.
 Example 1:
 1
 / \
 2 3
 / / \
 4 2 4
 /
 4
 The following are two duplicate subtrees:
 2
 /
 4
 and
 4
 Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
