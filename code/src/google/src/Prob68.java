 * 1.[ LeetCode,33] Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot
 unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise
 return -1.
 You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
 2.两个数组，返回两个⼀一个数组中存在的⽽而另⼀一个数组中不不存在的数组。
 3.[ LeetCode,22]Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all
 combinations of well-formed parentheses.
 For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
 [
 "((()))",
 "(()())",
 "(())()",
 "()(())",
 "()()()"
 ]
