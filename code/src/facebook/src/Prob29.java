 * 1. [LeetCode,29] Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using
 multiplication, division and mod operator.
 Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
 The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 Example 1:
 Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
 Output: 3
 Note:
 · Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
 · The divisor will never be 0.
 · Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within
 the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume
 that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overflows.

 2. [LeetCode,560]Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total
 number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
 Example 1:
 Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
 Output: 2
 Note:
 1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
 2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the
 integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
