 * 1. [LeetCode,212]Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in
 the board.
 Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent"
 cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used
 more than once in a word.

 words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
 [
 ['o','a','a','n'],
 ['e','t','a','e'],
 ['i','h','k','r'],
 ['i','f','l','v']
 ]
